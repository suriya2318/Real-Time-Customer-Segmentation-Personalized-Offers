# Real-Time-Customer-Segmentation-Personalized-Offers
This project uses KNIME to segment retail customers in real-time based on purchase behavior and demographics. It applies machine learning to predict discount usage and sends personalized offers via email. The goal is to boost sales through targeted marketing and automation. An end-to-end workflow is built entirely in KNIME.
